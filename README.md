# 🧠 LeetCode Binary & Bit Manipulation Roadmap

This roadmap is a curated list of LeetCode problems focused on **Binary**, **Bit Manipulation**, and **XOR-based** patterns — structured from **easy to hard**. It’s designed to help you master fundamental and advanced techniques by building on previous concepts.

---

## 📌 Goals

- Master binary representations and bit-level operations.
- Understand and apply XOR logic in real problems.
- Build up to solving medium-level bitmask and subset problems.
- Gain confidence with bit + string hybrid problems.
